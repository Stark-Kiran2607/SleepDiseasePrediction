# SleepDiseasePrediction - HypnoDiagnosis

First, run the BACK/sleep_disease_prediction.ipynb file to preprocess the data and download the required model files.

Save the downloaded model files into the FRONT/Models folder so the frontend can access them.

Then, run the frontend application (e.g., using streamlit run app.py) to start using the prediction and report generation features.

Make sure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt
